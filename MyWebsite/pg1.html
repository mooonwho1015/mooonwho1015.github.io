		<h1>Home Page</h1>

		<p>Welcome to my choose-your-own-adventure story. In this project, you will explore different places and decide where the journey goes next. Each page gives you 4 choices, 3 that lead to new paths and 1 to come back to home page. You can visit the green forest, meet a powerful dragon, climb the mountain trail, or explore a quiet village. Your decisions shape the story, so choose wisely and enjoy the adventure!</p>
