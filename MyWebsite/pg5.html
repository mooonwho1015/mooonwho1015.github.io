		<h1>The Quiet Village</h1>

		<p>At the foot of the mountain rests a peaceful village, wrapped in soft lantern-light. Smoke rises gently from chimneys, and the scent of warm bread drifts through the air. Though small and humble, the village carries stories older than stone.</p>

		<h2>About the Village</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>The villagers are known for their kindness and strong sense of community.</li>
    		<li>Every home is made of wood and clay, built carefully by hand.</li>
    		<li>A tiny market square sits in the center, where travelers share tales of their journeys.</li>
    		<li>Some believe the village was blessed long ago by a mysterious wandering sage.</li>
    	</ul>

    	<h2>You Visit the Village</h2>

    	<ol type="A">
    		<li>You enter the village and are greeted by children laughing near a fountain.</li>
    		<li>An elder waves you over, offering warm tea and a place to rest.</li>
    		<li>You walk the quiet streets, admiring the lanterns hanging from every doorway.</li>
    		<li>A gentle hush falls as villagers begin their evening prayers.</li>
    		<li>You feel calm and safe, as though the village itself is protecting you.</li>
    	</ol>
